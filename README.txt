Thank you for downloading Vanilla but better modpack!

This modpack doesn't add any blocks, mobs or dimensions, just more options and performance enhancing!

Follow the folders name and put the files inside them into the respective folder in your .minecraft folder.

p.s.: Some mods have this .disabled format, which doesn't work, these mods may change your experience entirely, making it not vanilla-like, if you would like to enable
those mods, just simply rename it and remove the ".disabled" text.

This modpack uses fabric.
